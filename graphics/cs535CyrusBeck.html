CYRUS-BECK CLIPPING ALGORITHM</h1></center>
<h3>Cyrus Beck Development</h3>
The Cyrus-Beck line clipping algorithm uses vector ideas to compute a line
clipped to a convex polygon. The input would be the line (L) and the polygon (a
2D array of vertices). The parametric vector form for a straight line is
<br>P(t) = P<sub>0</sub> + t(P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub>) which is a "mathematical"
shorthand for the pair of equations:<br>
x(t) = x<sub>0</sub> + t(x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>0</sub>)<br>
y(t) = y<sub>0</sub> + t(y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>)<br>
Which could be turned into computer code easily.
<br>Consider any edge E from the polygon (basically, an edge is formed
from 2 adjacent vertices V[i] and V[i+1]). Let Q be any point on the edge
E (we will use one of the vertices in the code below) and consider the vector from
Q to any point on the line L. Since the point is on the line L, it has to 
satisify the vector form of the line equation.  Thus, there is a value t with
P(t) producing the point, so the vector then becomes P(t) - Q. Using the OUTER NORMAL, N, 
to the edge E, we can decide inside/outside for the point P(t) by examining the sign
of the dot product of N and P(t)-Q.  <br>
<i><u>Remark:</u></i> The "classic" version of Cyrus-Beck used the
INNER normal (N<sub>inner</sub> = -N<sub>outer</sub>). This results in a change of
sign and thus slightly different comparisons in some of the if statements in the code below.<br>
The outer normal is used here because in 3D we always use the outer normal as the
surface normal, so to be consistent with the 3D case, the outer normal is used in the development here.
However, the code typically found in a reference book was probably developed from the
inner normal case - it still will work and can be used as is.
Note that INSIDE and OUTSIDE relative to the polygon make sense since the polygon is required to be CONVEX.
See below for a discussion of INSIDE
and OUTSIDE.  The outer normal is the one which lies in the outside. In 
function terms we would write this
as dotProduct (N, P(t)-Q). The sign will
be based on the cos(A) where A = angle between N and P(t)-Q and this angle
will tell us inside/outside. Remember that N is the outer normal
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;
if (dotProduct(N,P(t)-Q) &gt; 0)
&nbsp; P(t) OUTSIDE since A &lt; 90 degrees
else if (dotProduct(N,P(t)-Q) &lt; 0)
&nbsp; P(t) INSIDE since A &gt; 90 degrees
else
&nbsp; P(t) SHOULD BE ON EDGE E&nbsp;
&nbsp; this is because N would be perpendicular
&nbsp; to both E and P(t)-Q</pre>
Since we want the intersection of L and E, this last case is the one that
we want (dotProduct (N,P(t)-Q) = 0). Unsing the above parametric vector 
equation for a line --- substituting in P<sub>0</sub> + t(P<sub>1</sub>
- P<sub>0</sub>) (for the point on L) for P(t).  Then we solve for t by using various
vector and scalar/vector and dot product rules we get that 
<center>t = - dotProduct(N,P<sub>0</sub>-Q)/dotProduct(N,P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>0</sub>)</center>

<p>A value of 0 for the denominator is bad because we cannot divide by 0, so we 
consider the possible ways in which the denominator could be 0
</p><ol>
<li>
N = 0. This should never happen (the outer normal should never be the 0 vector)</li>

<li>
P<sub>1</sub> - P<sub>0</sub> = 0. This means that we have a degenerate
line - a single point.  Clipping a point does not make sense - we could show
the point (inside the region) or not show the point (outside).  The numerator
would tell us this because we have created a vector from Q to P<sub>0</sub>.</li>

<li>
dotProduct = 0. This means that edge E and line L are parallel. The question becomes
is L "inside" or "outside" of the polygon.  Since we have a point Q on the edge E and a point
P<sub>0</sub> on the line L and in the calculation for t we have taken the dot product
of the outer normal and the vector between a point on E and a point on L, we can test
for inside/outside.  If the numerator &gt; 0 then outside (N is the outer normal) and
convexity means that L misses the clipping area entirely.  If the numerator is &lt; 0 then 
L is on the inside BUT there will be NO intersection with the edge E to compute so we
can go on.  If numerator == 0 then E and L are the same line and the problem is finished.
</li>
</ol>
If we look at the parametric form of the line equation, we have that t &lt; 0 or t &gt; 1 are outside of the 
line segment we are working with.  thus, the t value must be between 0 and 1 to be interesting 
(on the line segment).
<ul>
<li>If we view increasing t as "moving" along the line segment, then we start at P<sub>0</sub> at t
= 0 and move towards P<sub>1</sub> at t=1. 
</li><li>A line divides the plane into two half-planes.  
</li><li>For a line formed from an edge of the clipping area, the clipping region is always 
completely contained in one of the half-planes (because the region is convex).  Call
this half-plane the INSIDE half-plane and the other the OUTSIDE half-plane. 
</li><li>Thus, as we "move" from t = 0 to t = 1 along the line segment,  
we can view an intersection as "entering" - going from the OUTSIDE halfplane 
to the INSIDE halfplace.  Or "exiting" - doing the opposite. 
</li></ul>
We can test 
these via the dot product of the line with the normal - the denominator in the 
calculation for t above.
<pre>if (dotProduct(N,P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>0</sub>) &gt; 0)
&nbsp; EXITING - since angle A &lt; 90 degrees
else if (dotProduct (N,P<sub>1</sub>-P<sub>0</sub>) &lt; 0)
&nbsp; ENTERING - since angle A &gt; 90 degrees</pre>
If we repeat this for each edge in the polygon -
<pre>for each (edge E in polygon)
{ generate t value&nbsp;
&nbsp; test for range 0 to 1
&nbsp; if (in range)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; classify as entering or exiting
}</pre>
We logically would generate two lists of t's - entering t's and exiting
t's. Note that we have required that the polygon be convex, here is where it is
used again.  Since the polygon is CONVEX only two of these values are "real". One
entering and one exiting t will generate the clipped line segment. The
values of t that we want are
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; t1 = MAX {t | t entering}
&nbsp;&nbsp; t2 = MIN {t | t exiting}</pre>
Finding the MAX and the MIN is easy - just keep "current MAX" and "current
MIN" in the above for loop. Thus we only need to have two t values at any
time in the above for loop. If we end with t<sub>entering</sub> &gt; t<sub>exiting</sub>
then the line L misses the polygon completely.
<h4>Outer Normal Calculation</h4>
This leaves us with the problem of determing the outer normal.  We know that if a
line has slope m then the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/m.  We can use this
to get the normal - the normal vector would have components (-1/m,1).  Here we examine
each edge of the polygon and compute the slope m for that edge. Computing m is simple
given that we have two points on the line.    
This gives us a "candidate" normal.  Because the polygon
is convex, we know that all of the other vertices of the polygon must be on the INSIDE
half-plane formed by the edge (as a line).  Thus if we take a vector from one of the 
vertices on the edge with one of the other vertices of the polygon, the sign of the dot
product with the candidate normal will tell us inner or outer.  If inner then just multiply
the normal by -1 to get the outer normal.

<h3>Liang Barsky Specialization</h3>
The Liang Barsky clipping algorithm is Cyrus Beck specialized to the "standard" rectangle.  In 
that case the outer normals are simple - they are the standard unit vectors i,-i,j, and -j (i = (1,0), 
j = (0,1)).  This also makes the polygon edges have simple equations and the dot product values 
needed for the numerator and denominator values for the four sides in the above equation for t 
would be very simple to compute by hand and "hard code" and so the above program can be rewritten.  
That rewriting results in code that looks quite different from Cyrus Beck. 

<pre>void LBLineClipping (float &amp;x0, float &amp;y0, float &amp;x1, float &amp;y1, bool &amp;visible)
{ float dx = x1 - x0;
   float dy = y1 - y0;
   float tE = 0.0, tL = 1.0;
   visible = FALSE;
   if ( dx == 0 &amp;&amp; dy == 0 &amp;&amp; ClipPoint(x0,y0))
     visible = TRUE;
   else 
   { if (CLIP (dx,xmin-x0,tE,tL))          // Inside relative to left side
        if (CLIP (-dx,x0-xmax,tE,tL))      // Inside relative to right side
          if (CLIP (dy,y0-ymax,tE,tL))     // Inside relative to bottom
            if (CLIP(-dy,y0-ymin,tE,tL))   // Inside relative to top
            { visible = TRUE;
               if (tL &lt; 1.0)
               { x1 = x0 + tL*dx;
                  y1 = y0 + tL*dy;
               }
               if (tE &gt; 0.0)
               { x0 += tE*dx;
                  y0 += tE*dy;
               }
            }
   }
}

bool ClipPoint (float x, float y)
{ // True if the point is inside the clip area &#8230;.
  // you write this one - xmin &lt;= x &lt;= xmax and 
  // ymin &lt;= y &lt;= ymax

}

bool CLIP (float denom, float numer, float &amp;tE, float &amp;tL)
{ float t;
   if (denom &gt; 0)
   { t = numer/denom;
      if (t &gt; tL)
        return FALSE;
      else if (t &gt; tE)
        tE = t;
   }
   else if (denom &lt; 0)
   { t = numer / denom;
      if ( t &lt; tE)
        return FALSE;
      else 
        rL = t;
   }
   else if ( numer &gt; 0)
     return FALSE;
   return TRUE;
}
